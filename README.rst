Installation
============

**WARNING**: The Pythonic ``SnapSearch-Client`` is currently undergoing

verify SSL certificates for HTTPS requests. Normally, this means you need to
have either `requests`_ or `PycURL`_ installed.

.. _`PycURL`: http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/
.. _`requests`: http://python-requests.org/

To install with ``pip``, simply:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install SnapSearch-Client-Python
